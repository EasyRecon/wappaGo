This tool is created to assemble different tools like https, naabu, gowitness and add a detection of the headless technology of chrome instead of httpx.

### Why

Because many tools need a chrome headless session. If you use several tools, for the same url, you have to open 2 chrome sessions, with this tool, only one session is needed.


## Todo

increase speed
code refacto


## Thank's

This tool uses several projectdiscovery libraries and is inspired by these tools.
